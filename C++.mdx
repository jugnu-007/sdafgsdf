## Class

- A class is an implementation of a type. It is the only way to implement User-defined Data Type (UDT)
- A class contains data members / attributes
- A class has operations / member functions / methods
- A class defines a namespace
- It offers data abstraction / encapsulation of Object Oriented Programming
- Classes are similar to structures that aggregate data logically
- Classes provide access specifiers for members to enforce data hiding that separates implementation from interface
	- private — accessible inside the definition of the class
	- public — accessible everywhere
- A class is a blue print for its instances (objects)




## Object

- An object of a class is an instance created according to its blue print.
- Objects can be automatically, statically, or dynamically created
- A object comprises data members that specify its state
- A object supports member functions that specify its behavior
- Data members of an object can be accessed by ”.” (dot) operator on the object
- Member functions are invoked by ”.” (dot) operator on the object
- An implicit this pointer holds the address of an object. This serves the identity of the object in C++
- this pointer is implicitly passed to methods




The state of an object is determined by the combined value of all its data members



## this pointer

- An implicit this pointer holds the address of an object
- this pointer serves as the identity of the object in C++
- Type of this pointer for a class X object: `X * const this;`
- this pointer is accessible only in member functions


## Access Specifiers


- Classes provide access specifiers for members (data as well as function) to enforce data hiding that separates implementation from interface
- **private** -> implementation -> generally used for attributes
	- accessible inside the definition of the class
	- member functions of the same class
- **public** -> interface -> generally used for member functions
	- accessible everywhere
	- member functions of the same class
	- member function of a different class
	- global functions
- The keywords public and private are the Access Specifiers
- Unless specified, the access of the members of a class is considered private



**Information Hiding:**

- The public attributes should not decide the state of an object
- The private member functions cannot be part of the behavior of an object


## Constructor

- It is a static member function without this pointer – but gets the pointer to the memory where the object is constructed
- Name is same as the name of the class
- Has no return type - not even void
- Initializer list to initialize the data members
- Implicit call by instantiation / operator new
- May be public or private
- May have any number of parameters
- Can be overloaded
