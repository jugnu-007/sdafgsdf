# Introduction


**Drawbacks of using file systems to store data**


- **Data redundancy and inconsistency**
	- Multiple file formats, duplication of information in different files
- **Difficulty in accessing data**
	- Need to write a new program to carry out each new task
- **Data isolation**
	- Multiple files and formats
- **Integrity problems**
	- Integrity constraints (e.g., account balance > 0) become "buried" in program code rather than being stated explicitly
	- Hard to add new constraints or change existing ones
- **Atomicity of updates**
	- Failures may leave database in an inconsistent state with partial updates carried out
	- Example: Transfer of funds from one account to another should either complete or not happen at all
- **Concurrent access by multiple users**
	- Concurrent access needed for performance Uncontrolled concurrent accesses can lead to inconsistencies
	- Example: Two people reading a balance (say 100) and updating it by withdrawing money (say 50 each) at the same time .
- **Security problems**
	- Hard to provide user access to some, but not all, data





## Data Model

- A collection of tools for describing
	- Data
	- Data relationships
	- Data semantics
	- Data constraints


- Relational model
- Entity-Relationship data model (mainly for database design)
- Object-based data models (Object-oriented and Object-relational)
- Semi-structured data model (XML)
- Other older models:
	- Network model
	- Hierarchical model




### Data Definition Language (DDL)

- Specification notation for defining the database schema
- DDL compiler generates a set of table templates stored in a data dictionary
- Data dictionary contains metadata (i.e., data about data)
	- Database schema
	- Integrity constraints
	- Primary key (ID uniquely identifies instructors)
	- Authorization



### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

- Language for accessing and manipulating the data organized by the appropriate data model
- DML also known as query language
- Two classes of languages
	- **Pure** - used for proving properties about computational power and for optimization
		- Relational Algebra (we focus in this course)
		- Tuple relational calculus
		- Domain relational calculus
	- Commercial - used in commercial systems
		- SQL is the most widely used commercial language

### Structure Query Language (SQL)

- The most widely used commercial language
- SQL is NOT a Turing machine equivalent language
- To be able to compute complex functions SQL is usually embedded in some higher-level language
- Application programs generally access databases through one of
	- Language extensions to allow embedded SQL
	- Application program interface (e.g., ODBC/JDBC) which allow SQL queries to be sent to a database



## Database Design

The process of designing the general structure of the database

**Logical Design**

Deciding on the database schema. Database design requires that we find a "good" collection of relation schemas.

**Physical Design**

Deciding on the physical layout of the database



### Object-Relational Data Models

Relational model: flat, “atomic” values

Object Relational Data Models
	- Extend the relational data model by including object orientation and constructs to deal with added data types
	- Allow attributes of tuples to have complex types, including non-atomic values such as nested relations
	- Preserve relational foundations, in particular the declarative access to data, while extending modeling power
	- Provide upward compatibility with existing relational languages


### Storage Management

Storage manager is a program module that provides the interface between the low-level data stored in the database and the application programs and queries submitted to the system.


#### Query Processing


#### Transaction Management


## Database Architecture

The architecture of a database systems is greatly influenced by the underlying computer system on which the database is running: 
- Centralized
- Client-server
- Parallel (multi-processor)
- Distributed



## Database Concept

### Attribute

The set of allowed values for each attribute is called the domain of the attribute




### Relation Schema and Instance

- A$_{1}$, A$_{2}$, …, A$_{n}$ are attributes

- R = ( A$_{1}$, A$_{2}$, …, A$_{n}$ ) is a relation schema

- Example:
	instructor = (ID, name, dept_name, salary)

- Formally, given sets D$_{1}$, D$_{2}$, …, D$_{n}$  a relation r is a subset of 
D$_{1}$ x D$_{2}$ x … x D$_{n}$

- Thus, a relation is a set of n-tuples ( a$_{1}$, a$_{2}$, …, a$_{n}$ ) where each a$_{i}$ implies to D$_{i}$

- The current values (relation instance) of a relation are specified by a table

- An element t of r is a tuple, represented by a row in a table

### Keys

- Let K subset of R
- K is a superkey of R if values for K are sufficient to identify a unique tuple of each possible relation r(R)
	- Example: {ID} and {ID,name} are both superkeys of instructor 
- Superkey K is a candidate key if K is minimal 
	- Example: {ID} is a candidate key for Instructor
- One of the candidate keys is selected to be the primary key 
- A surrogate key (or synthetic key) in a database is a unique identifier for either an entity in the modeled world or an object in the database 
	- The surrogate key is not derived from application data, unlike a natural (or business) key which is derived from application data



- Super Key: Roll #, {Roll #, DoB} 
- Candidate Keys: Roll #, {First Name, Last Name}, Passport #, Aadhaar # 
	- Passport # cannot be a key. Why? 
	- Null values are allowed for Passport # (a student may not have a passport) 
- Primary Key: Roll #
- Secondary / Alternate Key: {First Name, Last Name}, Aadhaar # 
- Simple key: Consists of a single attribute 
- Composite Key: {First Name, Last Name}

- Foreign key constraint: Value in one relation must appear in another
	- Referencing relation 
		- Enrolment: Foreign Keys – Roll #, Course # 
	- Referenced relation 
		- Students, Courses 
- A compound key consists of more than one attribute to uniquely identify an entity occurrence 
	- Each attribute, which makes up the key, is a simple key in its own right 
	- {Roll #, Course #}






### Relational Query Languages

Procedural vs. Non-procedural or Declarative Paradigms

- Procedural programming requires that the programmer tell the computer what to do 
	- That is, how to get the output for the range of required inputs 
	- The programmer must know an appropriate algorithm
- Declarative programming requires a more descriptive style
	- The programmer must know what relationships hold between various entities


# SQL

## Data Definition Language


The SQL data-definition language (DDL) allows the specification of information about relations, including:

- The schema for each relation 
- The domain of values associated with each attribute 
- Integrity constraints  And as we will see later, also other information such as 
- The set of indices to be maintained for each relations 
- Security and authorization information for each relation 
- The physical storage structure of each relation on disk



- *char*(n). Fixed length character string, with user-specified length n 
- *varchar*(n). Variable length character strings, with user-specified maximum length n 
- *int*. Integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine-dependent)
- *smallint*. Small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer domain type) 
- *numeric*(p,d). Fixed point number, with user-specified precision of p digits, with d digits to the right of decimal point. (ex., numeric(3,1), allows 44.5 to be stores exactly, but not 444.5 or 0.32) 
- *real*, double precision. Floating point and double-precision floating point numbers, with machine-dependent precision 
- *float*(n). Floating point number, with user-specified precision of at least n digits





### Create Table Construct

- An SQL relation is defined using the create table command:
```sql
create table r (A1 D1, A2 D2, ..., An Dn,
				(integrity-constraint1),
				...,
				(integrity-constraintk))
```
- r is the name of the relation 
- each Ai is an attribute name in the schema of relation r 
- Di is the data type of values in the domain of attribute Ai


```sql
create table instructor (
	ID char(5),
	name varchar(20) not null,
	dept_name varchar(20),
	salary numeric(8,2),
	primary key (ID),
	foreign key (dept_name) references department);
```
primary key declaration on an attribute automatically ensures not null







- Insert 
	- insert into instructor values (‘10211’, ‘Smith’, ‘Biology’, 66000); 
- Delete 
	- Remove all tuples from the student relation 
	- delete from student 
- Drop Table
	- drop table r 
- Alter 
	- alter table r add A D 
		- where A is the name of the attribute to be added to relation r and D is the domain of A 
		- All exiting tuples in the relation are assigned null as the value for the new attribute 
	- alter table r drop A 
		- where A is the name of an attribute of relation r 
		- Dropping of attributes not supported by many databases



### Basic Query Structure



A typical SQL query has the form: select A1, A 2, ..., A n from r1, r2, ..., rm where P  Ai represents an attribute  Ri represents a relation  P is a predicate  The result of an SQL query is a relation

#### The select Clause 

The select clause lists the attributes desired in the result of a query  corresponds to the projection operation of the relational algebra  Example: find the names of all instructors: select name from instructor  NOTE: SQL names are case insensitive (i.e., you may use upper- or lower-case letters.)  E.g., Name ≡ NAME ≡ name  Some people use upper case wherever we use bold font
