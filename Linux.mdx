## chroot

chroot is an operation on Unix and Unix-like operating systems that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot access files and commands outside that environmental directory tree. This modified environment is called a chroot jail.

Changing root is commonly done for performing system maintenance on systems where booting and/or logging in is no longer possible. `chroot` command can be very useful:
- To create a test environment.
- To recover the system or password.
- To reinstall the bootloader.
- Rebuilding the initramfs image.
- Building packages in a clean chroot.



```sh
$chr=/home/jay/mychroot
mkdir -p $chr/{bin,lib,lib64}
cp -v /bin/{bash,ls} $chr/bin

list="$(ldd /bin/bash | egrep -o '/lib.*\.[0-9]')"
for i in $list;
do
	cp -v --parents "$i" "${chr}";
done

list="$(ldd /bin/ls | egrep -o '/lib.*\.[0-9]')"
for i in $list;
do
	cp -v --parents "$i" "${chr}";
done

chroot $chr /bin/bash
```

## Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation is a cyberattack technique where an attacker gains unauthorized access to higher privileges by leveraging security flaws, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities in the system.


### Types of Privilege Escalation

- Vertical Privilege Escalation: This occurs when a lower-privileged user accesses functions or content reserved for higher-privileged users. For example, a regular user gaining administrative privileges.
- Horizontal Privilege Escalation: This occurs when a user accesses the resources or functionality of another user who has similar levels of privileges. For example, a user accessing another user's account details or data.
